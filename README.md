# PyCrop
Python implementation of a simple modular 1D crop model.

Information about the original FORTRAN model and explanation can be found at http://dssat.net/about/modular-approach-example.
The original code was by RICARDO BRAGA and JADIR ROSA (for course AGE 5646-Agricultural and Biological Systems Simulation),
date: 03/31/1997 Modified 07/1999 

Re-written in Python (V 3.4), by Benjamin A. Laken (blaken@geo.uio.no) http://www.blaken.com

I hope to extend this in many ways as time goes on. For an example of how to use the model check the Test_example.ipynb noetbook,
which makes use of Bokeh for visulization.
