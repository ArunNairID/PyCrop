# PyCrop

Early and experimental Python implementation of a 1D crop model.

Information about the original FORTRAN model and explanation can be found at http://dssat.net/about/modular-approach-example.
> The original code was written by RICARDO BRAGA and JADIR ROSA for a course (AGE 5646-Agricultural and Biological Systems Simulation, date: 03/31/1997 Modified 07/1999).

An example of how to use the model is given in example.ipynb noetbook, which makes use of Bokeh for visulization.

To install and see an example of the code run:

* `git clone` the repo
* From inside the repo run `pip install .`
* `cd` to `PyCrop/src/examples` and start a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)
* Run `example.ipynb` with the Notebook

This code is an experiment, and will undergo significant changes.
